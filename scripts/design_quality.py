"""Measure whether this pipeline actually designs *correct* circuits.

    python scripts/design_quality.py --trials 3
    python scripts/design_quality.py --trials 3 --plan          # with plan.py on
    python scripts/design_quality.py --offline-selftest         # no key, no cost

Every other quality gate in this repository checks something downstream of the
question this script asks. DRC checks geometry, the enclosure kernel checks the
case, the critic asks a model for an opinion. None of them can tell a 3.3 V
supply from a 3.3 V supply wired backwards. Since ``spice/registry.py`` landed
there is a trusted, licence-clean source of device behaviour for op-amps, the
555, fixed regulators and connectors -- so for the first time the *proposal*
stage can be scored against a specification written in volts and hertz.

**This costs money and needs ``GOOGLE_API_KEY``**, so it lives in ``scripts/``
and pytest never collects it -- the ``scripts/simulate_demo.py`` convention.

How the measurement is built
----------------------------

For each prompt in :data:`CASES` the script runs
:func:`silkscreen.agents.propose.propose_circuit` for real, ``--trials`` times,
and records three separate things that are deliberately never folded into one
number:

1. **Did it validate at all**, and after how many repair rounds. This is what
   the repo already knew how to measure.
2. **Structural compliance**: did the answer contain the part that was asked
   for, obey the prompt's explicit prohibitions ("do not add connectors"), give
   every supply pin a decoupling capacitor, and provide a power entry.
3. **Does the circuit work**, by simulation, against clauses written from the
   *English request* rather than from the circuit's own component values. "The
   rail is 3.3 V under a 10 mA load" is a restatement of what the user asked
   for; "the period is ln2*(R1+2*R2)*C" would be a restatement of what the
   model happened to choose, and would pass on a blinker that blinks once an
   hour. Every clause here is of the first kind.

The oracle finds its probe points **structurally**, never by guessing net
names: ``spice/registry.py`` binds each device's pins to its subcircuit's
terminals, so ``model.pins`` says which of the model's pin names is VOUT, which
is VCC and which is IN-. A circuit that calls its rail ``VOUT_3V3`` instead of
``+3V3`` is scored on its electrons, not its vocabulary.

Load resistors and supplies are added by this script, not expected from the
model: the IR says nothing about what drives a board (``spice/deck.py``'s stated
boundary, "a circuit is not a testbench"), so the fixture belongs to the bench.

What this does NOT prove is written out in ``docs/design-quality.md`` and
printed at the end of every run. Read it before quoting a number from here.

    used is the model's choice and not part of the request.

    A dual op-amp usually has *two* sections wired that way, because tying the
    spare one as a buffer on a rail is the standard "defined state" the request
    asks for (``test_spice.py``'s ``AMP_LM358`` does exactly this). So the

    supply rail: the request is for a buffered *divider* node, and a section
    buffering ground is the unused half by construction. Ambiguity that
    survives that rule refuses rather than picking the flattering answer.
