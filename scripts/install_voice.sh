# Provision Hardy's voice: Kokoro-82M, locally, no key and no per-word cost.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `service/tts.py` deliberately refuses to download
# weights on demand -- a first spoken word that silently pulls 330 MB is a
# surprise on a metered connection and a hang on a hot path. That refusal is
# right, but until now its consequence was that the recipe existed ONLY as
# prose inside a Python docstring (`kokoro_paths`), so "provisioning is an
# explicit operator step" meant, in practice, "there is no way to do it that
# anybody can find". A refusal to act automatically is only honest if the
# manual path is real. This is the manual path.
#
# Running this script IS the consent. It says what it will fetch and how big
# that is before it fetches anything, and it re-runs safely: a file already
# the right size is left alone.
#
#     ./scripts/install_voice.sh
#
# Then restart the service and check:
#
#     curl -s localhost:8081/speak | python3 -m json.tool
#
# `"selected": "kokoro"` means Hardy has her voice. Anything else prints the
# reason in words -- `service/tts.py` never answers with a quiet zero.

# kernels for those graphs fall back to reference implementations on ARM.

# "optimise" this to the smaller file. See `kokoro_paths` for the full table.
