"""Booking a spec review: an agenda becomes a calendar hold with a Meet link.

The product rule this exists for: a finished run should not end in a wall of
text. The open questions become an agenda, the agenda becomes half an hour on
the calendar with the people who can answer them in the room, and the meeting
decides what a paragraph could not.

This module is the *scheduling* half. The agenda itself is
``silkscreen.specreview.SpecReview`` -- validated model output, built in the
engine -- and the only surface consumed here is its ``as_dict()``, so this
package never imports the engine to schedule (the ``runner.py`` convention
taken one step further: the import is not merely lazy, it is absent). A plain
dict of the same shape works identically, which is what lets the deterministic
fallback below exist without a model call.

The honesty rules of the existing calendar path carry over unchanged and are
the reason several of these functions refuse rather than guess:

* An agenda with **no blocking item does not get a meeting**. "Nothing needs a
  meeting" is a real answer; inventing an item to fill the slot is not.
* If the review has not run, nothing is booked and the reason says "the
  review step has not run". :func:`agenda_from_result` reads that fact from
  the result (``Agenda.reviewed``, ``Agenda.skip_reason``) and
  :func:`schedule_spec_review` refuses such an agenda, so a caller that
  forgot to check (``service/deliver.py``, ``__main__``) cannot book a
  meeting about a board nobody reviewed.
* Every unrouted net is named in the description. A review invitation that
  says the board is done over a ratsnest misleads exactly the person who has
  not opened it yet.
* The description is **HTML-escaped**: Calendar renders a subset of HTML in
  it, the same reason ``chat.py`` escapes card text.
