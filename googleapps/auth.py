"""OAuth 2.0 installed-app flow with PKCE, on the stdlib.

``python -m googleapps auth`` (and Hardy's ``POST /deliver/auth``) opens
Google's consent page in the browser, catches the redirect on a 127.0.0.1
loopback port, exchanges the code, and writes the token JSON to the token
path with mode 0o600. After that, every Gmail and Calendar call goes through
:func:`access_token`, which refreshes transparently when the stored token has
expired and persists what came back.

Security rules, all load-bearing:

- PKCE is S256. The ``code_verifier`` lives only in this process's memory for
  the duration of the flow -- it is never written to disk and never logged.
- The token file is chmod 0o600, on create *and* on every rewrite.
- Tokens are never printed. Errors that mention the token talk about the
  file, not the contents.
- A missing or revoked token raises :class:`AuthError` telling the user the
  one command that fixes it, rather than a bare HTTP 401.
- **The granted scopes are recorded and believed, not assumed.** Under
  Google's granular consent every scope on the consent screen is its own
  checkbox, so a user can grant Calendar and decline Gmail and still land on
  a successful redirect. The token response's ``scope`` field is what Google
  actually granted; it is persisted beside the token and re-read on refresh
  (a refresh response may omit ``scope``, which per RFC 6749 §5.1 means
  unchanged -- the record is kept, never blanked). Everything that claims a
  destination is usable reads that record, so a declined checkbox is a
  refusal before the pipeline spends a model call rather than an HTTP 403
  after the board already exists.

The consent URL is on ``accounts.google.com``, which is deliberately absent
from the transport allowlist: it is only ever *opened in the user's browser*,
never addressed by this package's own HTTP client. The one token endpoint we
POST to is ``oauth2.googleapis.com``.

# Every parameter below was checked on 2026-09-08 against Google's own
# open-source installed-app client -- ``google-auth-oauthlib``, now at
# ``googleapis/google-cloud-python`` in
# ``packages/google-auth-oauthlib/google_auth_oauthlib/flow.py`` -- rather than
# against a doc summary. What matched, function by function:
#
# * ``Flow.authorization_url`` sets ``access_type`` "offline" by default, then
#   ``code_challenge`` = base64url(sha256(verifier)) with the padding stripped
#   (``b64_challenge.decode().split("=")[0]``) and ``code_challenge_method``
#   "S256" -- the same S256 pair :func:`pkce_pair` builds. Its verifier is 128
#   characters drawn from ``ascii_letters + digits + "-._~"``; ours is 86
#   characters of base64url, a subset of the same RFC 7636 unreserved set and
#   inside the same 43..128 range.
# * ``Flow.fetch_token`` sends ``client_secret`` *and* ``code_verifier``. A
#   Google "Desktop app" client has a secret and is expected to present it,
#   which is why :func:`exchange_code` sends both and why PKCE is an addition
#   here rather than a replacement.
# * ``InstalledAppFlow.run_local_server`` binds an ephemeral port and sets
#   ``redirect_uri`` to ``"http://{host}:{port}/"``. This module uses
#   ``http://127.0.0.1:{port}`` -- the loopback *IP*, which Google's installed
#   app documentation names alongside ``localhost``, and without the trailing
#   slash, which upstream itself makes optional
#   (``redirect_uri_trailing_slash``). The same string is sent in the consent
#   URL and in the exchange, so the two cannot disagree.
#
# ``prompt=consent`` and ``include_granted_scopes`` are ours, not upstream's;
# the reasons are at the parameters themselves.
