"""Usage-credit billing for Ada, in the shape ``googleapps/`` established.

Stdlib only -- no ``stripe`` SDK -- because this makes two REST calls and the
repo already talks to Slack, Google and Meet the same way. Every outbound
request crosses ``transport.Transport`` so the suite runs offline with no key.

The model is Devin's, scaled: prepaid compute units that draw down, a small
entry payment that becomes credit, and auto-reload at a threshold -- with a
monthly cap, because this bills an agent and a retry loop is the normal
failure mode.
