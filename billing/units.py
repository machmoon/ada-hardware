"""Compute units and money, both as integers, for the same reason.

``engine/silkscreen/units.py`` makes every dimension an integer nanometre
because float millimetres destroy boards. The identical argument applies here:
0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3, and a balance that drifts by a thousandth of a cent per
transaction is a reconciliation bug that surfaces months later as "we cannot
explain this number".

So:

* money is **integer cents**, never a float and never a Decimal string;
* compute is **integer milli-KCU** (mKCU), 1 KCU = 1000 mKCU.

One KCU is one minute of engine wall-clock attributable to a run -- the same
shape as Devin's ACU (~15 minutes of agent work), scaled to the fact that a
Ada run is minutes rather than a quarter hour. It is deliberately *time*,
not "one model call": a call that reads four datasheets and a call that
answers "no" cost the same under a per-call meter, and users notice.
