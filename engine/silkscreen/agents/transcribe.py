"""Speech to text, through the same seam as every other model call.

The desktop app records a spoken board request and needs it back as text.
Gemini accepts inline audio the same way it accepts inline PDFs, so this rides
the existing :class:`~silkscreen.agents.model.Model` protocol -- the audio
travels as a :class:`~silkscreen.agents.model.Document` with an audio MIME
type -- and therefore needs no new key, provider, or SDK surface. Keeping the
call here preserves the layering rule: ``agents/`` is the only place a model
call lives, and :class:`ScriptedModel` keeps the tests offline.
