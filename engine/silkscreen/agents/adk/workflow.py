"""The pipeline as an ADK dynamic workflow.

One orchestrator node runs read, plan, propose, review, place, placement repair,
schematic and route, each as its own child node. The nodes hold no logic
of their own: every one of them calls the matching body in
:mod:`silkscreen.agents.stages`, which is what keeps the two drivers emitting
the same events. ``placement_repair``, ``schematic``, ``route``,
``review_start``, ``enclosure_start``, ``sourcing_start``, ``simulate_start``,
``review``, ``enclosure``, ``sourcing`` and ``simulate`` are always run -- each
stage body owns the decision to do nothing when its feature is off
(``review_start``, ``sourcing_start`` and ``simulate_start`` hold that switch
themselves, as the straight-line driver does, since those bodies have none),
so the graph never has to branch.

Four stages are two nodes each because they run on worker threads. The critic
is the first pair: ``review_start`` launches it as soon as the spec validates
-- it reads the spec and the datasheet facts and nothing else -- and
``review`` joins it after placement repair, so it answers inside ``place``'s
fixed CP-SAT budget instead of on the tail of the run, and exactly one
worker-model call is ever in flight. ``enclosure_start`` launches the case
right after that join, from a snapshot of the placed board, and ``enclosure``
joins it after route. Sourcing is the same pair, started right after the
enclosure and joined right after it, and the SPICE verdict is a third pair,
started and joined after sourcing.

Each node is handed the run token as ``node_input`` and returns it, so the token
is the only value ADK ever sees; the rest is looked up from the registry in
:mod:`.runner`.
