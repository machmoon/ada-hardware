"""Propose an enclosure, then make the model fix its own mistakes.

The :mod:`silkscreen.agents.propose` loop, applied to 3D (docs/ai-cad-plan.md
v2, decision 18): the model's output goes through
:func:`silkscreen.enclosure.ir.parse_enclosure_spec`, then through
:func:`silkscreen.enclosure.cad.build_enclosure` and
:func:`silkscreen.enclosure.kernel.verify_model`, whose signed-margin clauses
are the acceptance gate. A :class:`~silkscreen.enclosure.errors.KernelError`
goes back to the model as a repair item naming its failure class; so does a
failing clause.

The kernel is the **only** path (docs/ai-cad-plan.md v3, 2026-09-08). Without
build123d there is no case: :func:`propose_enclosure` raises
:class:`~silkscreen.enclosure.errors.KernelUnavailable` naming the ``cad``
extra before it spends a model call. The v1 OpenSCAD emitter used to stand in
here and it built a measurably different box behind a fit receipt that could
not fail, which is a worse outcome than a refusal in words.

How hard the loop pushes back is the ``rigorous`` flag's call. The **fast
default** (``rigorous=False``, demo speed) repairs spec-validation failures
and a build that raises, allows one repair round, and ships the first spec
that *builds* -- the kernel report rides along even when clauses fail, the
honest receipt. **Rigorous mode** (``rigorous=True``) is the strict loop:
every failure -- JSON shape, unprintable wall, a cutout naming a part the
board does not have, a kernel clause -- is batched back as a single repair
prompt over three repair rounds, and a failing report blocks. The loop is
bounded and gives up loudly with :class:`EnclosureProposalError`.

An optional **critic** (decision 17) looks at a rendered snapshot grid of the
built model and names at most a few findings; they are filtered to parts the
board has or cutouts the spec names (the :mod:`~silkscreen.agents.review`
rule), appended to the kernel report as warnings, and are never a gate.

The model never receives or invents a raw dimension to transcribe (plan
decision 3): the prompt carries the *measured* board facts -- outline size,
part rectangles, heights, mounting holes, connector plugs, edge-adjacent refs
with their faces -- purely so the model can choose style within bounds, and
the deterministic builder injects every millimetre from the envelope and
:mod:`silkscreen.enclosure.rules`, not from the model's answer.

Intended live tier: :data:`~silkscreen.agents.model.CHEAP_MODEL` -- choosing a
lid style is a mechanical pass, not a reasoning one. The tier is the caller's
to construct; this module only ever sees the :class:`Model` protocol.

What each "mount" means:
  "holes":   standoffs with insert bores placed at the board's own mounting
             holes (only valid when the board facts list mounting holes);
  "pins":    standoffs with locating pins through the mounting holes, the lid
             presses the board down (also needs mounting holes);
  "corners": four plain corner standoffs under the board edge (no holes needed);
  "none":    the board rests on the floor with no standoffs.
"insert" is the screw size bored into the standoffs ("self_tap" is an
undersize hole for a self-tapping screw); it also sizes a "screw" lid's
screws. "lip" is a ring lip that registers in the cavity; "snap" adds a
bead-and-groove detent to it ("friction" is accepted as "lip").

Hard rules -- a proposal breaking any of these is rejected automatically:

1. You choose STYLE only. Every dimension is measured -- from the PCB file
   and from the design-rule tables (wall fits, insert bores, plug sizes) --
   and injected by the builder; never invent or repeat a board measurement.
2. A cutout's "ref" must name a part listed in the board facts below. For a
   known connector the opening is sized from the mating PLUG (a USB-C plug
   overmold, not the receptacle); for any other part from its real
   courtyard. You only pick the part, the face, and the margin.
3. Only put a side cutout on a face the part actually sits near (the board
   facts name each part's nearby faces); a part far from a wall gets a tunnel
   to nowhere and is rejected.
4. "mount": "holes" or "pins" needs mounting holes on the board; when the
   facts say there are none, choose "corners" or "none".
5. Walls below 1.2 mm do not print. Clearance below 0.5 mm binds.
6. Omit "cutouts" entries you are not sure about -- a solid case that fits is
   better than an opening onto the wrong part.

    verify through this one function and never through the model

    :class:`KernelError` naming its failure class, a :class:`CutoutError` --
    is a repair item in **both** modes, since nothing was built to ship. A
    report that fails is a repair item only in rigorous mode; fast mode
    accepts it and the caller attaches it, so the failure rides the receipt
    rather than vanishing.
