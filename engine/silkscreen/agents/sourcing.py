"""Look the parts up, and check what the model claims before repeating it.

The :mod:`silkscreen.agents.propose` loop applied to the bill of materials:
the model is shown the rows :func:`silkscreen.sourcing.bom_rows` derived
from the board -- ref, kind, value, package -- and asked for a manufacturer,
a part number, and a datasheet URL per row. Its answer goes through
:func:`silkscreen.sourcing.parse_sourcing_response`, every failure batched
back as one repair prompt, and after the budget the loop gives up loudly
with a warning and the rows unchanged rather than shipping a guess.

What comes back is then **checked, not trusted, to the extent it can be**.
A part number is put to a distributor when one is configured
(:mod:`.distributor`: Mouser, behind ``MOUSER_API_KEY``) and becomes
``"verified"`` only on an exact listing; otherwise it stays ``"proposed"``
with the reason on the row. A datasheet URL can always be checked:
:func:`probe_pdf` fetches the first eight bytes and reports ``"verified"``
only when they read ``%PDF-``, because distributors serve HTML viewer
pages from ``.pdf`` links (the :mod:`~silkscreen.agents.datasheet` lesson)
and a link that opens a web page is not a datasheet the engineer can file.
The probe is a ``probe=`` seam so the suite stays offline; the URL goes
through the same SSRF guard :func:`~silkscreen.agents.grounding.fetch_pdf`
applies, since a model that can name any URL can name the metadata
service. Probes run a few at a time under one wall-clock budget for the
whole board, because the order step waits on this stage and a handful of
slow manufacturer hosts must not turn that wait into minutes; a URL the
budget never reached is ``"unprobed"``, said out loud, never ``"none"``.

The prompt says a null beats an invention, and the parser makes null cheap
to say: every field but ``ref`` may be null, and an empty string is read as
null rather than as a part number of zero characters.

Intended live tier: :data:`~silkscreen.agents.model.CHEAP_MODEL` -- naming a
common part is a recall pass, not a reasoning one. The tier is the caller's
to construct; this module only ever sees the :class:`Model` protocol.

You are a junior hardware engineer sourcing the parts on a finished PCB

Hard rules -- an answer breaking any of these is rejected automatically:

1. One entry per ref, every ref covered, no ref you were not given.
2. null beats invention. If you are not sure a part number exists, say null.
   A wrong MPN gets ordered; a null gets looked up by a person.
3. The package must match the land pattern named for the part (a 0603
   resistor is not a 0805 resistor). If nothing matches, say null.
4. A datasheet_url must be the direct link to a PDF on the manufacturer's
   own site, or null. Never a distributor page, never a search result. The
   URL will be fetched and checked; a link to an HTML page is reported.
5. Part numbers are at most 64 characters. Notes are short.
