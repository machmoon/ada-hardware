"""Adversarially review a circuit against the datasheets it was drawn from.

Structural validity is not correctness. A netlist can pass every check in
:mod:`silkscreen.netlist` and still drive an input pin, wire a regulator's
feedback divider to the wrong node, or put a ceramic cap where the part needs
tantalum. That gap -- between "connected" and "connected *correctly*" -- is what
no EDA tool checks and what this module exists for.

The reviewer is prompted to *refute* the design. An agent asked "is this
correct?" says yes.

Three things happen to what it answers, in this order:

**Specialisation.** One prompt asks the model to review the circuit as three
named specialists -- power, signal, manufacturability -- and to label every
finding with the specialist that raised it. That is one model call, not three;
the measurement behind that choice is in ``docs/critic-split.md``.

**Premise checking.** Every finding must state, in structured form, the
premises about the circuit it rests on: a part's value, a terminal's net, a
terminal being floating, a part's pin count. Each premise is checked against
the validated :class:`~silkscreen.netlist.CircuitSpec`, which is the ground
truth the board is actually built from. A finding whose premise the spec
refutes is dropped and the refutation is reported. This is
:mod:`meetings.intent`'s quote filter applied to a circuit instead of a
transcript: there the model must supply a verbatim quote and the code checks it
against the source; here it must supply a premise and the code checks it
against the source. In both cases the model is made to say something that can
be *wrong*, rather than only something that can be *unconvincing*.

**Merging.** Two specialists arguing the same defect must reach the engineer
once, not twice, and the merge must be visible. The shape is taken from tools
that have merged findings across independent analysers for years -- semgrep's
``dedup_and_sort``, sarif-sdk's ``WhatComparer``, golangci-lint's suppression
reporting -- each cited at the function that borrows from it.

A fourth thing happens only when asked for. ``refute=True`` spends one more
call in which every surviving finding must defend itself, which is
``audit/effort.py``'s ``refute_rounds`` at ``deep``, batched. Who asks is the
effort level: it is :attr:`~silkscreen.agents.effort.EffortProfile.refute`,
on at ``thorough`` and off below it, because it is a model call nobody pressed
for and because, measured, it throws away true findings along with false
ones -- a cost worth paying when someone asked for the careful answer.

Everything this module produces is an *argument*, never a measurement. The
:class:`Domain` on a finding says which specialist raised it; it never says
how the claim was established, so nothing here can enter a result looking like
a fact the way ``audit/findings.py``'s ``Origin.PROVEN`` does. That distinction
is why a simulation verdict still does not belong on
``PipelineResult.findings``.

REVIEW_PROMPT = """\
You are reviewing a circuit someone else designed. Your job is to find what is
WRONG with it. Assume it contains at least one real error and look for it.
Do not compliment the design and do not summarise it.

Review it as THREE separate specialists, one after the other. Each one looks
only at its own domain and ignores the other two. Label every finding with the
specialist that raised it.

POWER -- how the board is powered.
- Rails: where does each supply come from, and is every part's supply pin on
  the right rail at the right voltage?
- Regulators: input and output capacitor VALUE and DIELECTRIC. An LDO whose
  stability depends on output-capacitor ESR will oscillate on a ceramic.
- Decoupling: does every supply pin have one, of the right value? Is there
  bulk capacitance on each rail?
- Ground: is there one return, and does every part reach it?
- Dissipation and absolute-maximum ratings.

SIGNAL -- what each pin is doing.
- Is every pin connected to something appropriate for its FUNCTION? An output
  driving an output, a supply pin on a signal net, an input left floating.
- Are mode/reset/enable/boot pins tied to a defined level?
- Are pull-up/pull-down and timing values right for the job? Do the arithmetic
  of any timing network and say what it actually comes to.
- Are reference and compensation pins bypassed rather than driven?
- Unused sections of a multi-channel part: are they tied to a defined state?
- Is anything shorted, or is a required component missing entirely?

MANUFACTURABILITY -- whether this can be built and assembled correctly.
- Are the values standard, orderable parts?
- Is any part polarity- or orientation-critical in a way that gets assembled
  backwards?
- Does the named package exist for the named part, and does its pin numbering
  match what the netlist claims?
- Is any part specified so loosely that a buyer picks the wrong one?
- Thermal: can the chosen package dissipate what its role demands?

Return ONE JSON object, no prose, no code fence:

{
  "findings": [
    {"domain": "power|signal|manufacturability",
     "severity": "blocker|marginal|note",

Rules:
- "blocker" means the board will not work. Use it only when you are sure.
- "claims" is the part of your finding that can be CHECKED. List every fact
  about THIS circuit that your finding depends on, using only the four kinds
  above and only ids that appear in the circuit below. Each one is compared
  against the netlist, and a finding resting on a claim the netlist
  contradicts is thrown away -- so state the claims you are actually relying
  on, and state them accurately. Do not put your recommendation in a claim:
  a claim says what the circuit IS, never what it should be.
- Use the exact part ids and net names given below. A finding naming only
  parts that are not in the circuit is thrown away.
- A diode or LED in this netlist is a two-leg passive whose leg 1 is the
  ANODE and leg 2 the CATHODE; the schematic symbol and the footprint's
  cathode bar follow the same numbering. Judge polarity by that, never by a
  library's numbering (KiCad's own diode footprints put the cathode on pad 1;
  this netlist does not) and never by a net's name.
- Cite a page ONLY when a supplied datasheet fact actually supports the claim.
  An invented citation is worse than none.
- The circuit below is a NETLIST. It carries no manufacturer part numbers, no
  package sizes, no tolerances and no voltage ratings, because those are
  chosen by a later step. "The parts are not specified precisely enough to
  order" is true of every circuit you will ever be shown here, so it is not a
  finding. Say what is wrong with THIS circuit, not with the notation.
- If a specialist genuinely finds nothing, it contributes no findings. Do not
  pad the list to give each specialist something to say. Three specialists
  with nothing to say is a better answer than three specialists each padding
  to one finding.

REFUTE_PROMPT = """\
A reviewer made these claims about the circuit below. Your job is to REFUTE
them. Take each one in turn and decide whether it survives.

Refute a claim if the circuit as given does not support it, if it contradicts
the netlist, if its reasoning does not follow from its own premises, or if it
is a generic remark that would be true of any circuit. **Default to refuting
when you are unsure.** A review that reports a non-problem costs more trust
than one that misses a small one.

    found nothing" and "the critic said something unreadable" the same value,
    and every consumer downstream then printed the first sentence for the
    second fact: a "board ready" subject line, a skipped review invite, a
    Slack thread reporting a clean board.

    A ``ReviewError`` is not fatal to a run -- :func:`~silkscreen.agents.
    stages.review_stage` records it and keeps the board, the sourcing-stage
    convention -- but it must never be silent.

    ``refute`` spends **one** further call in which every surviving finding
    must defend itself; see :func:`_refute` for the measurement that motivates
    it. It is off by default and the drivers set it from the effort level
    (``thorough`` only), which is how "a model call nobody pressed for" stays
    the rule the sourcing, enclosure and agenda stages already follow.

    **One model call.** The three specialists share it. Separate calls were
    measured against this design and did not buy enough to justify three times
    the cost and latency (``docs/critic-split.md``); the invariant that exactly
    one worker model call is in flight holds either way, but a single call also
    keeps the critic inside the placement solver's budget, where it costs the
    engineer no wall clock at all.
