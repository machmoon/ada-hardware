"""Validated intermediate representation for an enclosure.

The ``netlist.py`` founding lesson, applied to 3D: a model proposes a JSON
:class:`EnclosureSpec`; nothing builds geometry until it validates. The model
chooses *style within bounds* — lid type, wall thickness, which connectors get
cutouts — and never types a board millimetre; every measured dimension is
injected by the deterministic emitter from the ``.kicad_pcb``.

Dimensions are **integer nanometres** everywhere inside the IR. The JSON at
the model boundary uses mm floats; the conversion happens exactly once, here,
in :func:`parse_enclosure_spec`.

Ref *existence* is deliberately not checked here — the IR does not know the
board. ``verify.py``'s ``verify_fit`` owns that check (a cutout naming an
absent ref is a hard ``CutoutError`` there, per the ``edge_refs`` convention).
