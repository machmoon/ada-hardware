"""build123d (OCCT) emitter for the enclosure: the v2 geometry half.

The model proposes an :class:`~.ir.EnclosureSpec`; this module turns it and a
:class:`~.board_shape.BoardEnvelope` into real B-rep solids, with every
measured number coming from the board and every design number from
:mod:`.rules`. It is the only enclosure emitter: the v1 OpenSCAD text path
was removed on 2026-09-08 (docs/ai-cad-plan.md v3), so without the ``cad``
extra there is no case and the callers say so rather than degrading.

Frames (docs/ai-cad-plan.md v2)
-------------------------------

Geometry is in the **assembled** frame: X as KiCad, Y flipped so ``front``
is the KiCad max-Y board edge (the package's frame map), Z up, origin at the
base's outer bottom-left-front corner. The map from a KiCad absolute point
``(x, y)`` to the assembled frame is::

    X = board_x0 + (x - envelope.x_min_nm)        board_x0 = wall + strip + clearance
    Y = board_y0 + (envelope.y_max_nm - y)        board_y0 = wall + clearance
    Z(board bottom face) = wall + standoff height

where ``strip`` is the corner-boss strip a screw lid adds on the left and
right of the cavity (zero otherwise). :func:`_ax`/:func:`_ay` are the only
two places that cross, mirroring ``emit._sx``/``emit._sy``.

The lid is **built** in the assembled frame (so cutouts, vents and the label
use the same coordinates as the base) and **stored** in its printed
orientation -- outer face on the bed at z = 0, lip pointing +Z -- by moving
it through the inverse of ``lid_assembled``. ``lid_assembled`` is the
build123d ``Location`` ``((0, outer_y, base_z + lid_z), (180, 0, 0))``: a
half-turn about X, so printed ``(x, y, z)`` lands at assembled
``(x, outer_y - y, base_z + lid_z - z)``. Printability checks run on
``model.lid`` as stored; mating checks run on ``model.lid.moved(model.lid_assembled)``.

Lid style ``"none"`` stores ``lid = None`` and ``lid_assembled = None``; the
case is then the base alone and ``outer_nm[2] == base_z``.

Units: everything is integer nanometres until the single :func:`_mm`
crossing that feeds the kernel, which works in mm floats. ``params_mm`` is
the receipt of every number used, mm floats rounded to three places.
