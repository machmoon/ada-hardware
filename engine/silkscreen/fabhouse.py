"""Real fabricators: what they can build, what they charge, and where we stop.

A fab package is not an order. An order names a *house*, a *service*, a
quantity, a set of options that house actually offers, a price and a lead time.
This module is where the engine meets three real ones -- OSH Park, JLCPCB and
PCBWay -- and it is deliberately the only module in the package that knows any
of them exist.

Three things are worth reading before the code.

**The capability check is not the design rule check.** :mod:`silkscreen.audit`
asks whether the board is *right*: are courtyards clear, are tracks clear of
each other, is copper inside the outline. This module asks the different and
narrower question of whether *this house* will build it -- a 0.13 mm track is a
perfectly good track and OSH Park will refuse it, while JLCPCB will not. Neither
check subsumes the other, and a board can pass one and fail the other.

**Only one of the three can be priced.** OSH Park publishes a price *rule* --
dollars per square inch, three copies included -- so a quote is arithmetic over
the board's own geometry and is exact. JLCPCB and PCBWay both quote through
APIs that require a registered application's key and secret. This project does
not create accounts at fabricators and holds no credentials, so for those two
houses the honest output is a complete, validated order specification, a link
to their own quote page, and no number at all. :class:`PriceBasis` carries that
distinction in the type rather than in a comment, so nothing downstream can
render an estimate as though it were a quote.

**Nothing here submits.** There is no code path from this module to a purchase,
by design and not by omission -- see :func:`submit_order`, which exists solely
to refuse and to say why.

Silkscreen prepares orders. It does not place them.

Everything up to this line is reversible: a board can be re-placed, re-routed,
re-checked and re-packaged at no cost but time. Submitting an order is not. It
spends money, it consumes a fab slot, and a mistake in it arrives as a box of
scrap copper a week later.

The gate in silkscreen.gate is good, and it is not good enough to close that
loop. It proves what it measures and says so; it cannot prove the circuit is
the circuit the buyer meant. An agent that clears its own checks and then buys
the board has converted every remaining class of design error -- a wrong part
value, a mis-read datasheet pin, a topology that validates and does not work --
into money, silently and at machine speed. That is a categorically different
failure from a misplaced footprint, and no amount of additional checking makes
it the same one.

So the last step is a person. Silkscreen hands them the package, the evidence
and the price, and stops.
