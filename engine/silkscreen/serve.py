"""``silkscreen serve``: start the HTTP service and open the Hardy desktop app.

Thin on purpose. The server itself is ``service.app`` -- this module only does
the three things that stand between "the module exists" and "the app is open":

* Load ``.env``. The service deliberately does not read it (only the CLIs do),
  so without this step a key sitting in .env produces a service that answers
  every request with a missing-key 502, which reads as an outage.
* Resolve the port once, from ``--port`` or ``PORT``, and say what happened
  when the bind fails. The default is 8081, the repository's local
  convention (the frontend dev proxy and the desktop app both expect
  ``127.0.0.1:8081``), because 8080 is routinely already taken on a
  developer machine. The container is different: ``service.app`` and the
  ``Dockerfile`` keep Cloud Run's 8080, and this default never reaches them
  -- ``make_server`` is always handed the resolved port.
* Open the app, since "runs in one command" means the app is on screen. The
  desktop overlay (``app/``) is the product, so it is the default; ``--web``
  opens the browser SPA instead and ``--no-browser`` opens nothing. From a
  checkout with the Tauri toolchain the overlay is this tree's own build
  (``npm run tauri dev``, a child of this process that stops with it); without
  one, an installed ``Hardy.app``; with neither, the browser, saying why.
