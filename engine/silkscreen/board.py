"""Emit a complete ``.kicad_pcb`` from a validated circuit.

This is the step the previous project never had. Its "layout engine" pasted a
board a human had already drawn, through the clipboard, into a running KiCad
window -- so it could only ever produce the one design it had been handed.

Here a :class:`~silkscreen.netlist.CircuitSpec` becomes real footprints with
real pads on real nets, placed by the CP-SAT solver, written as KiCad 8
s-expressions. No KiCad installation, no footprint library on disk, no GUI.

The output is verified by round-tripping through ``kiutils`` in the test suite:
if KiCad's own parser cannot read what we wrote, the tests fail.
