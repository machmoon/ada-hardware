"""Validated intermediate representation for a circuit.

The original pipeline passed raw ``json.loads`` output from an LLM directly into
SKiDL part construction. Every downstream bug traced back to that: unvalidated
pin numbers, component types outside the supported set, references to nets that
were never created, and silently dropped connections.

This module is the contract. An LLM proposes a :class:`CircuitSpec`; nothing
touches KiCad until it validates. Failures name the offending field so they can
be fed back to the model for repair rather than crashing a worker thread.
