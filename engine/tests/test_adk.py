"""The ADK driver, held to the straight-line driver's contract.

:mod:`silkscreen.agents.adk` runs the same seven stage bodies as
:mod:`silkscreen.agents.pipeline`, through a Google ADK workflow rather than a
straight line. Nearly every assertion here is one that ``test_agents.py``
already makes about the SDK driver, because the claim being tested is that a
client -- the service, and the SPA behind it -- cannot tell the two apart.

``google.adk`` is imported behind a flag rather than with
``pytest.importorskip``: ``scripts/check_docs.py`` checks the test counts the
docs quote against what pytest collects, and a module-level importorskip
collects nothing at all on a machine without the optional extra, which would
make the documented count depend on the machine instead of on the suite.
