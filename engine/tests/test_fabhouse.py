"""Tests for the fab-house layer: capabilities, prices, and the hard stop.

Two properties matter more than the rest here.

The first is that an unpriced quote carries no numbers. A zero in a money field
reads as "free" at a glance, and the whole purpose of the object is that a human
looks at it before spending anything.

The second is that :func:`submit_order` cannot be made to succeed. That one is
tested the way a safety interlock is tested -- by trying to defeat it.
