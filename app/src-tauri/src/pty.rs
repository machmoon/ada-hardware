//! A real pseudo-terminal, so the terminal skin is a terminal.
//!
//! The overlay's terminal skin was asked for as "a literal terminal, so it
//! doubles as Hardy and terminal". That rules out the shape this repo already
//! had: [`crate::cli`] runs an allowlisted tool, waits, and hands back the
//! captured stdout. `vim`, `htop`, `ssh`, tab completion, Ctrl-C and a shell
//! prompt all need a pty on the other end of the file descriptor, not a
//! pipe, because they ask the kernel whether they are talking to a terminal
//! and behave differently when the answer is no.
//!
//! `tauri-plugin-shell` has no pty, which is where an earlier round of this
//! work wrongly concluded Tauri could not do it. It can: `portable-pty` (the
//! WezTerm crate, MIT) opens one directly from here, which is exactly what
//! `marc2332/tauri-terminal`, `Shabari-K-S/terminon` and `tauri-plugin-pty`
//! all do. Electron's Hyper faces the identical problem and answers it the
//! identical way with `node-pty`.
//!
//! Three decisions worth stating, because each has a wrong version that
//! looks fine until it doesn't:
//!
//! * **Output goes over a [`Channel`], not `app.emit`.** Tauri's own docs say
//!   the event system "is not designed for low latency or high throughput"
//!   and may deliver out of order. For a terminal, out-of-order delivery is
//!   scrambled bytes on screen.
//! * **Bytes are base64, not a `String`.** A read can land mid-UTF-8 and a
//!   lossy conversion would replace the split codepoint with U+FFFD, so a
//!   character would be permanently corrupted by nothing worse than a buffer
//!   boundary. The frontend writes the decoded `Uint8Array` and lets xterm.js
//!   do the decoding, which is stateful and handles splits.
//! * **`resize` is a real command.** A pty left at the 24x80 default makes
//!   every full-screen program draw into the wrong box; it is the single most
//!   common bug in the terminal-in-Tauri repos above.
//!
//! ## Security posture
//!
//! This is deliberately *not* [`crate::cli`]'s allowlist. It is the user's own
//! interactive shell, with their environment and their privileges — the same
//! thing Terminal.app gives them. That is the point of the feature and it is
//! also its whole risk, so:
//!
//! * a session only exists because the user opened the terminal skin;
//! * nothing model-generated is written into a session by this module — the
//!   frontend routes a typed line to the shell or to Hardy by the sigil the
//!   user typed, and any model-*proposed* command is staged as text for the
//!   user to press Enter on, never injected;
//! * sessions are capped and every one is killed on close, so a closed
//!   overlay does not leave shells running.
