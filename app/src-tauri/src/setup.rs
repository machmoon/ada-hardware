//! The first-launch gate.
//!
//! On a fresh install the strip stays hidden and the dashboard opens at
//! `/welcome` as a Regular (Dock-bearing, focusable) app until the Setup
//! Assistant finishes or is skipped; every launch after that comes up exactly
//! as before -- strip visible, Accessory policy, dashboard at `/workbench`.
//! The one fact that decides which launch this is lives in `settings.json`
//! (`tauri-plugin-store`, in `app_data_dir`) under `setup.completed`, and it
//! is read here, in Rust, before any webview has booted -- the frontend cannot
//! cover that window, which is the same reason `lib.rs` sets the activation
//! policy in `setup()` rather than leaving it to the `set_app_icon_visibility`
//! command.
//!
//! Two rules keep the gate from stranding the user. The store is built here
//! with autosave *before* the JS side ever calls `load("settings.json")`: the
//! plugin caches one `Store` per path and ignores the options of every later
//! load, so if JS won the race its writes would sit in memory and never reach
//! disk. And closing the dashboard mid-setup finishes the setup rather than
//! hiding the only window: an Accessory app whose strip is hidden and whose
//! dashboard is closed has nothing left to click on.
//!
//! The JS side (`src/lib/settings/store.ts`) writes the same file and the same
//! keys; the vocabulary is frozen in the plan (contract C1/C3). Rust reads
//! only `setup.completed` to decide the gate. `setup.version` is a hint the JS
//! side uses to offer "Run Setup Again" and is written, never read, here.
