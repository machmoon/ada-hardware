// A step run has to reach the dashboard the same way a one-shot run does, or

// `pages/kaleo/index.tsx`) leaves the whole review window empty forever:
// board, schematic, findings and artifacts are live code nobody can see.
// `useSilkscreenRun` publishes once, at `done`. A step run has no single end —
// the engineer may stop after `route`, or carry on through review, sourcing,
// order and case — so this file decides three things, deliberately:
//
//   WHEN: from the first step that actually produced a board, and again after
//   every later successful step. Placement is where a board first exists
//   (`place` answers with `kicad_pcb` and `placements`), so waiting for the
//   last step would hide a real board for most runs, and publishing at
//   `propose` would announce a run the board tabs cannot draw.
//
//   WHAT IDENTITY: one entry per engine session (`steps-<session>`), so a
//   later step UPDATES the published run rather than adding a second copy of
//   the same board to the dashboard's history.
//
//   WHAT SHAPE: exactly the fields the step responses actually carry, mapped
//   onto the one-shot `RunResult` where the two vocabularies already agree.
//   Nothing is invented to fill a gap: `nets` is a count on a step response
//   and a list of names on `RunResult`, so it does not cross at all, and the
//   `sourcing`/`enclosure` blocks have no `RunResult` field to cross into.
//   Every field the workbench reads is optional there and has its own empty
//   state, which is why an absent one shows as "not yet" rather than a crash.
