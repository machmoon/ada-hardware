  /**
   * Ask the engine to stop, then find out whether it did.
   *
   * Until this existed the button aborted a socket and nothing else: the
   * pipeline went on solving and went on spending, and the strip said
   * "cancelled". `service/runs.py` gives the run a name and a cancel route,
   * and `client.ts` has had `cancelRun`/`runStatus` for it, unused.
   *
   * The two halves are deliberately separate, because the engine's own
   * docstring is careful about it: `runs.cancel` "says *requested*, not
   * *stopped*", the flag being read only when the pipeline next emits an
   * event — Celery's `Control.revoke`, which the docstring cites. So the POST
   * answers "we asked", and the poll that follows answers "and this is where
   * it got to". Neither is allowed to speak for the other.
