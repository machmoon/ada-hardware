/**
 * One input line, two destinations: the shell, or Hardy.
 *
 * The ask was a terminal skin that "doubles as Hardy and terminal" — not a
 * terminal with a chat pane bolted beside it. Wave and Tabby both put AI in a
 * separate panel; the one piece of prior art that actually shares the input
 * line is Butterfish (MIT), and its answer is the right one: no classifier,
 * no mode switch, no round trip to decide. The *first character the user
 * typed* decides, and because the user typed it, they always know where the
 * line went.
 *
 * Butterfish's rules, adopted:
 *
 * - a line starting with a capital letter goes to the model as chat;
 * - `!` prefixes an agent request — Hardy may propose commands;
 * - everything else is a shell command, unchanged.
 *
 * Two rules of our own, both because the Butterfish set has holes that bite
 * in a terminal people actually live in:
 *
 * - **A leading space forces the shell.** `Rscript`, `Xvfb`, `Setup.exe` and
 *   any absolute path a user capitalised are real commands that start with a
 *   capital letter, and silently sending one to a model instead of running it
 *   is the failure mode that would make people turn this off. Shells already
 *   teach " " as the escape hatch via `HISTCONTROL=ignorespace`, so this
 *   borrows a reflex rather than inventing one.
 * - **Nothing routes while the alternate screen is up.** When `vim`, `htop`
 *   or `less` is running, every keystroke belongs to that program — `:wq` is
 *   not a shell command and `Quit` is not a question for Hardy. xterm.js
 *   reports this directly as `buffer.active.type`, so it is a fact we read
 *   rather than a guess.
