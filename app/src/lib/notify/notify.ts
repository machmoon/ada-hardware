// Native macOS banners for the milestones of a run, fired from the strip.
//
// The rules, all of them load-bearing:
//
//   - Only the `main` webview fires. Both windows run the same hooks over the
//     same run (the dashboard adopts what the strip publishes), so without
//     this every milestone would land twice. The test button is the one
//     exception, since it is pressed in the dashboard.
//   - "Focused" is asked of the Rust side (`kaleo_has_focus`: is either of
//     Ada's windows the key window), because `document.hasFocus()` in a
//     58 px non-activating panel is not "Ada is frontmost". The DOM answer
//     is the fallback while the command does not exist.
//   - Copy is frozen here (`milestoneCopy`) and honest: never "board ready"
//     over unrouted nets, never a case or sourcing outcome before it has been
//     collected — a background job that has left the engine's list has
//     finished, and only the collecting step's warning says whether it
//     failed. Banners carry no URL: a bearer-gated engine address is not
//     something to paint on a lock screen.
//   - `sendNotification` is synchronous and void in the plugin (it is
//     `new window.Notification(...)` behind Tauri's patched constructor), so
//     it is called, not awaited, and nothing here ever throws into a hook.
//
// The plugin cannot say whether a banner was shown (`docs/overlay-skins.md`
// §Notifications): "Sent" is the strongest word any caller may use.
