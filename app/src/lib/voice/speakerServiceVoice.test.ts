// The service-voice branch of `speech/speaker.ts`.
//
// Kept in this directory rather than appended to `speech/speaker.test.ts` so
// the service-voice work stays in one place and out of a file another agent
// has been editing. What it pins is the honesty rule, not the plumbing: when
// the engine has no voice, Hardy must STAY SILENT and say why — she must not
// quietly hand the line to the Compact system voice. That is the exact
// failure this change exists to remove: for weeks the user heard the robot
// and nothing anywhere explained that it was a fallback at all.
//
// It also pins the bug underneath that, which was not a policy question but
// a typo-grade defect: `speaker.engineBaseUrl` read localStorage raw, so on
// any install where nobody had hand-typed an engine address it returned
// `""`, the service backend was never even constructed, and `POST /speak`
// was never called once. See the last test in this file.

  // and types an address — so `engineBaseUrl()` returned `""`, `defaultMakeBackend`
  // skipped the service branch entirely, and Hardy spoke every word she has ever
  // spoken on that machine through `speechSynthesis`, while Kokoro sat loaded
  // and answering `GET /speak` with `"state": "ready"`.
  //
  // Asserting on the fetch URL rather than on the backend's `name` is
  // deliberate: `name` would have been `"service"` for a backend pointed at
  // `""`, which is exactly the kind of green test that let this ship.
