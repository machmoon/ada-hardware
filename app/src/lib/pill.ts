// The words on the folded pill.
//
// The pill used to be three icons — a dot, a mic, an arrow — and Pat's verdict
// was that it was too small to be worth folding to: it could not answer the
// two questions you fold the strip down and still need answered, which are
// "is the microphone hot, and what is it billing me" and "is anything
// happening". So the pill carries a word for each. That is also what lets it
// stay small honestly: the one thing on a folded strip that can spend money is
// the ear, and the ear's word spells out what it is spending.
//
// Both words are measurements or states, never a mood. Neither invents a
// number: the paid-window count is the listener's own `sent`/`cap`.
