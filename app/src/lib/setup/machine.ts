// The first-launch Setup Assistant, as a pure step machine.
//
// One decision per screen, Continue/Back, "Set Up Later" everywhere — the
// macOS Setup Assistant shape. The machine is deliberately DOM-free and
// store-free: `useSetup` persists whatever `reduce` returns, so a reload
// resumes where the user left off, and the tests here can walk every path
// without a window.
//
// Two vocabularies, kept apart on purpose:
//   - a *step* is a screen (`SETUP_STEPS`, one dot each);
//   - a *card* is a thing the user can connect or enable on a screen
//     (`SETUP_CARDS`). `setup.skipped` and `setup.remaining` record cards,
//     not steps — "Skipped: Google, Billing" is a sentence about cards, and
//     the Rust close-mid-setup path copies `remaining` into `skipped` so a
//     closed window is honest about what never got connected.
