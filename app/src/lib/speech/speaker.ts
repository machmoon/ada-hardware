// The one mouth: a controller that speaks at most one utterance at a time,
// and QUEUES the rest.
//
// Three rules shape everything here.
//
// One utterance at a time, because a voice that talks over itself reads as
// broken. Until 2026-09-07 that was implemented as "a new `speak` stops the
// old", which is a different rule wearing the same words, and it cost two
// real defects: a digest split into per-sentence utterances was audible only
// for its last sentence, and two stage moments landing close together
// truncated the first one mid-word. So a second `speak` now WAITS instead of
// interrupting. The queue is what makes sentence-at-a-time synthesis possible
// at all, which is also the cheapest half of the time-to-first-audio work —
// sentence one can be spoken while sentence two is still being generated.
//
// Stop still means stop. `stop()` clears the queue AND halts the current
// utterance; nothing pending survives it. That is the point of the generation
// counter in `backends.ts` carried up a level: barge-in beats queueing, always
// — an assistant that finishes reading a stale digest after you interrupted it
// is worse than one that drops the line. `announce.takeMicFloor` calls
// `stop()`, so the user taking the microphone empties the queue by
// construction.
//
// And `speak` never throws to the caller: voice is garnish, not the meal, so
// every failure mode — no key, no speechSynthesis, a 401, a refused
// autoplay — degrades to silence with one console warning that names the
// backend and the status, never the key.
