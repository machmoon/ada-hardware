// Optional macOS banners for a run that finished while you were somewhere
// else. Off until someone turns it on, and silent unless macOS agrees.
//
// WHY THE TAURI PLUGIN AND NOT THE BROWSER `Notification` API
// -----------------------------------------------------------
// Verified in this checkout rather than assumed:
//
//   - `@tauri-apps/plugin-notification` 2.4.0 is already a dependency
//     (`app/package.json`), so the JS half is present.
//   - Its `sendNotification` is literally `new window.Notification(title,
//     options)` (node_modules/@tauri-apps/plugin-notification/dist-js/
//     index.js), and `requestPermission` is
//     `window.Notification.requestPermission()`. So the plugin is NOT a
//     different transport from the "browser API" — it is the browser API,
//     over a `window.Notification` that the plugin's Rust half replaces with
//     one that reaches `UNUserNotificationCenter`.
//   - That Rust half is not installed yet: `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` has no
//     `tauri-plugin-notification`, `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` registers none, and
//     neither capability file grants `notification:default`. Without those
//     three, macOS WKWebView's own `Notification` object is what the page
//     gets, and WKWebView does not implement Web Notifications at all — the
//     constructor is simply absent, so a "just use the browser API" build
//     would be silently dead on macOS.
//
// So: plugin, and the Rust entries are reported as wiring rather than
// guessed at here. Everything below degrades to a no-op — never a throw —
// while that wiring is missing, which is also exactly how it behaves in
// Vitest and in a plain `npm run dev` browser tab.
//
// WHERE THE PREFERENCE LIVES
// --------------------------
// `notify.enabled` in the settings store (`src/lib/settings/keys.ts`), NOT a
// new `KALEO_STORAGE_KEYS` entry. That key already exists, already defaults
// to `false`, is already validated and already crosses between the strip and
// the dashboard webviews. A second key for the same preference is the bug
// `keys.ts` warns about in its own header comment: two sources of truth for
// one switch, drifting apart the first time a user flips one of them.
