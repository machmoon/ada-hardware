/**
 * The overlay window's size, as a function of which shape the bar is in.
 *
 * This replaces measuring. The old path (`useOverlayHeight`) watched the
 * Card with a `ResizeObserver` and sent one `set_window_height` per animation
 * frame in which the clamped measurement changed — so a live run was a stream
 * of native resizes, each one arriving a frame *after* the content it was
 * meant to make room for, and each one also waking the dock (see
 * `docs/overlay-motion-audit.md` §2.2, §3.2, §3.5).
 *
 * The audit's §4 finding is the whole argument for this module: of the states
 * the overlay actually has, all but two have a height that is knowable from
 * the state alone, because the tall ones already carry a scroll clamp
 * (`ActivityFeed` is `max-h-40`, `step-scroll` is `max-h-[14rem]`). A size
 * that is known before the frame is painted can drive the native resize and a
 * CSS transition off the same number in the same frame; a measured one cannot,
 * because it is by construction one frame late. Every launcher surveyed for
 * this rebuild (coco-app, Albert, Wox, Cerebro, sol) sizes from state.
 *
 * Pure on purpose: no Tauri import, no DOM. `useOverlaySize` is the only thing
 * that talks to the window.

 * calls. A state is not a stack of blocks; if a real combination clips, the
 * fix is a new member here with its own measured constant, not a fallback to
 * measuring, which would put the frame-late resize back.
 *
 * Positional states (docked bottom, drag-pinned) and `hidden` are absent by
 * design. Docking is position, never size (audit §1.3 state 17), and hiding
 * the overlay must keep the last size rather than resize a `display:none`
 * element to 600×58 (audit §1.3 state 19, §3.14) — which it does here for
 * free, because a hidden overlay reports the same state it had.
