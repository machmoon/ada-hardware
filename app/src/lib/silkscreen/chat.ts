/**
 * One orchestrator turn: ask Ada a question, get her answer back.
 *
 * `POST /chat/stream` already existed on the engine and had no client. It is
 * the right endpoint for the terminal skin's Ada half — but it has a property
 * that makes a naive client dangerous, and this module exists to handle it:
 *
 * **The orchestrator can start a board run.** `service/app.py` hands it a
 * `generate` callable and the model decides whether to call it, so a typed
 * sentence can become a paid pipeline. This repo's standing rule is that a
 * paid run is never invisible, so:
 *
 * - every frame is described as it arrives (`describeFrame`), so a run in
 *   progress prints stage by stage instead of the terminal sitting silent;
 * - `ranBoard` is reported on the outcome, so the caller can say a board was
 *   generated rather than letting it look like a chat reply that took a while.
 *
 * Transport mirrors `generateStream` in `client.ts` deliberately — same
 * timeout ceiling, same NDJSON line splitting, same rule that a terminal frame
 * already received survives a connection that then dies.
