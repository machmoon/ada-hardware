/**
 * Pick the overlay's shape.
 *
 * The brief was "have options": the overlay carries a control strip over
 * KiCad, and how much of one it should be depends on the work. The catalogue
 * lives in `@/lib/overlay-skin` so this control, the wizard and the overlay
 * read the same list; `SkinPreviewPicker` draws it here and in the wizard.
 *
 * The choice is stored, not lifted into a context, because the overlay is a
 * separate webview from this one. localStorage plus a `storage` event is how
 * the two windows already talk (see `KALEO_STORAGE_KEYS.LAST_RUN`), so a skin
 * picked here reaches the overlay without a new bridge.
