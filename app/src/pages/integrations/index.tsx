/**
 * Every Ada surface, whether it is set up, and what to do about it if not.
 *
 * The panel exists because the answer to "can this thing email me the board?"
 * was previously spread across a Python module docstring, an `.env.example`
 * line and a failed run. Each surface has its own credentials, its own
 * optional package and its own idea of being half-configured, and none of that
 * was visible anywhere until something failed.
 *
 * Two rules run through the whole page. Nothing that exists is hidden — an
 * integration the engine cannot even import is listed as `unavailable` rather
 * than dropped, because "not built here" and "not on the menu" are different
 * facts and only one of them is true. And the fixes are the engine's own
 * words: the settings live in the environment the service was started with,
 * which this window cannot reach, so the hints are printed verbatim.
