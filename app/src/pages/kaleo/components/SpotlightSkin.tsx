/**
 * The overlay's Spotlight skin: one field, and a list only when there is one.
 *
 * The brief this exists for is subtraction — "i think a lot of the design
 * have a lot of clutter but ig i like the serach bar from apple", and "the
 * overlay isnt meant to have so much visual clutter". So at rest this is a
 * single bare `<input>` and literally nothing else: no toolbar, no chips, no
 * status strip, no submit button sitting there greyed out waiting to be
 * earned. Every other element in this file is conditional, and the condition
 * is always "there is now a reason for it".
 *
 * The shape is cmdk's (`pacocoursey/cmdk`) rather than a hand-rolled search
 * box, and `docs/overlay-skins.md` records what reading the real source
 * changed:
 *
 *  - cmdk's core renders ONE bare `Primitive.input` with `border: none;
 *    outline: none` and puts any border on the root. Ada's `PromptBar`
 *    wraps its field in `h-9 rounded-md border border-input/50 bg-muted/30`;
 *    that inner bordered box is the hand-rolled tell and it is absent here —
 *    the panel (the overlay `Card`) carries the radius, the field carries
 *    nothing.
 *  - `outline: none` is not cosmetic. sol passes `enableFocusRing={false}`
 *    for the same reason: without it macOS paints a blue focus ring *inside*
 *    a borderless panel, which is the one piece of chrome this skin cannot
 *    afford.
 *  - The real Spotlight blur is an NSVisualEffectView added *below* the
 *    webview (window-vibrancy), not a CSS `backdrop-filter`, which would only
 *    blur what this webview already painted and never the KiCad canvas
 *    behind the window. So there is no blur in this file at all — that half
 *    is a Rust change (`apply_vibrancy` in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`), and
 *    faking it here would look like the feature while doing nothing.
 *  - cmdk's Linear preset sets `caret-color: #6e5ed2`. Copied literally that
 *    is a second hue on a bar that has to sit on both KiCad grounds, so the
 *    caret takes the app's own `primary` instead, and nothing here flips
 *    with the OS theme.
 *
 * The component is pure presentation: it holds the highlighted row and
 * nothing else. The query, the run, the command list and the engine all
 * belong to the page, so this skin can be dropped in beside `PromptBar`
 * without a second copy of any of that state.
