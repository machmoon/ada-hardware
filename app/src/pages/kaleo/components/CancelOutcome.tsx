/**
 * What pressing Cancel actually did.
 *
 * Until `service/runs.py` gave a streamed run a name, this app's Cancel was an
 * `AbortController` and nothing else: the socket closed, the pipeline went on
 * solving and went on spending, and the strip said "Run cancelled. The engine
 * may have finished the work it had already started, but nothing came back."
 * That sentence was a guess in both directions — it could not know whether the
 * engine stopped, and it could not know what the attempt cost.
 *
 * Now the engine can be asked, so this card reports rather than guesses. It
 * renders `useSilkscreenRun`'s `cancellation`, which keeps three states apart
 * and never lets them collapse:
 *
 * - `asked` — the POST is out and nothing has answered. Neither stopped nor
 *   still running: not known yet, and it says so.
 * - `settled` — the engine answered and a poll saw the run reach a terminal
 *   state. The only state allowed to say what it cost.
 * - `unknown` — we could not ask, or we asked and the run was still going when
 *   we stopped watching. **It may still be spending**, and that is the whole
 *   reason this state exists as its own word.
 *
 * The three-way split is Argo Workflows' `NodePhase`
 * (`pkg/apis/workflow/v1alpha1/workflow_types.go`), which keeps `Skipped`,
 * `Failed` and `Error` — "an error other than a non-0 exit code", i.e. no
 * verdict at all — as three separate phases rather than folding the last into
 * the second. The tone follows BuildKit's `progressui`
 * (`util/progress/progressui/display.go`, `trace.displayInfo`), where
 * `isCanceled` is tracked as a flag distinct from `hasError` and coloured with
 * `colorCancel` rather than `colorError`: a deliberate stop is not a failure
 * and must not be painted as one.
 */

/**
 * The cost line, in the vocabulary `service/metering.py` actually uses.
 *
 * Four answers, and the fourth is the one that is easy to lose: the engine
 * said nothing at all about cost (an older service, or a frame this window
 * never saw). "Not charged" and "we were not told" are different facts, and
 * a UI that renders the second as the first is inventing a reassurance.
 *
 * Where a count is zero it gets a word rather than a numeral — vitest's
 * `getStateString` (`packages/vitest/src/node/reporters/renderers/utils.ts`,
 * shipped at `vitest/dist/chunks/index.*.js:99`) opens with
 * `if (tasks.length === 0) return c.dim('no tests')` and omits every
 * zero-valued category instead of printing "0 failed". A small surface earns
 * its space by never printing a zero.
