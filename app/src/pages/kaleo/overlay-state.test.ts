// The overlay's discrete state, on its own.

// `overlayStateFor` is the one place the page decides what shape it is, and
// the sizing hook trusts it completely — a wrong answer here is a window that
// is the wrong size with no measurement left to correct it. So it is pure and
// it is tested without a React tree, the convention `overlay-mode.ts` and
// `overlay-dock.ts` already set for the overlay's other two decisions.
//
// The page module is imported for it, which drags the whole overlay's import
// graph in; the mocks below are only there to keep that graph from reaching
// Tauri at import time.
