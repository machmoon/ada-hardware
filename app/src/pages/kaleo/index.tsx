/**
 * The shape the overlay just left, while it is still fading out.

 * stays mounted is the *surface* — an empty Card at the outgoing shape's size,
 * taken from `sizeFor` so the ghost and the window it is standing in for read
 * the same table — and never the outgoing subtree: re-mounting `PromptBar` or
 * `StepPanel` for the length of a swap would run a second copy of every hook
 * in them, including the microphone.
 *
 * **Ghost the shrink, never the grow**, and the reason is geometric rather
 * than aesthetic. The two shapes are concentric opaque cards of different
 * widths, so at any moment the composite alpha is `a` where only the outgoing
 * covers, `b` where only the incoming does, and `a + b - ab` where both do.
 *
 * Collapsing, the arriving pill is strictly *inside* the departing bar, so
 * every pixel the bar had and the pill does not is covered by the ghost alone.
 * Without it that whole area is gone in one frame — a hard cut of a 600 px
 * surface — which is exactly what the ghost exists to prevent, and why its
 * fade is `.kv-shape-out`'s slow-falling ease (motion.css §2): an early fall
 * *is* the hole.
 *
 * Expanding, the departing pill is strictly *inside* the arriving bar, and the
 * incoming card already paints that area itself. A ghost there preserves
 * nothing — it only adds `a(1 - b)` of extra coverage inside the pill's
 * outline while the bar is still rising, which renders as a denser capsule
 * floating in the middle of the field for the length of the swap. That is not
 * a theoretical concern: it was photographed on screen, and removing the ghost
 * from this direction is what removes it. The bar simply rises uniformly on
 * `.kv-shape-in`'s fast-rising ease, which is the whole of what a grow needs.
 *
 * The asymmetry is the same one `useOverlaySize` already keeps for the window
 * — grow at once, shrink on a delay — read on the surface instead of the
 * frame: the larger shape is the one that persists.

 *
 * This is the fix for the expand direction, and the reason it needed one is
 * asymmetry that was never noticed because only one half of it is visible.
 * `useOverlaySize` grows at once and shrinks after `SHRINK_DELAY_MS`, so a
 * *collapse* already happens inside a window that is still 600 px wide: the
 * pill has all the room it needs from the first frame and the cross-dissolve
 * plays over correct geometry. An *expand* has the opposite shape. React
 * commits the bar and the browser lays it out and paints it in the frame the
 * state changed; `invoke("set_window_frame")` goes out from an effect after
 * that paint, and even that is only a request — the pinned `tao` dispatches
 * `set_content_size_async` onto the main GCD queue and returns. So the bar's
 * first painted frames are laid out against a ~132 px viewport: the field
 * collapses to nothing, the controls stack or clip, and then everything
 * reflows to 600 px when the resize lands. That reflow is what reads as the
 * pop, and no easing curve can hide it — a cross-dissolve between a squashed
 * bar and a correct one is a dissolve between two different layouts.
 *
 * So: keep showing the old shape until the viewport can hold the new one. The
 * window resize and the content swap stop being two animations on two clocks
 * and become one ordered pair — grow, then swap; swap, then shrink — which is
 * the same envelope OpenWhispr gets structurally by sizing its native window
 * to a footprint ladder that is always larger than the pill animating inside
 * it (`vendor/openwhispr/src/helpers/windowConfig.js` — `WINDOW_SIZES.BASE`
 * 176x120 around a 40x40 idle pill).
 *
 * Only the width is gated. It is a constant (600) that the window always
 * reaches, whereas the tall states' heights are content-driven and may never
 * match a target exactly — a height gate would spend its deadline on every
 * step-panel frame. Height clipping also degrades gracefully (the card is
 * `max-h-full overflow-y-auto`); a width reflow does not.
 *
 * Not reduced-motion gated, for `SHRINK_DELAY_MS`'s reason: nothing moves
 * during the wait. It is a frame or two of the shape that was already on
 * screen, which is as true with the media query set as without it, and
 * skipping it would show reduced-motion users the one artifact this exists to
 * remove.

            the measured box, and `aria-hidden` because it says nothing.

            "Under" is load-bearing and is why every shape wrapper below is

            of the shape replacing it: expanding, a blank 132 px capsule hung
            over the middle of the prompt field for the length of the swap;
            collapsing, a blank 600 px card hid the pill's three controls until
            it had finished fading. Photographed both. Making the wrappers
            positioned puts them in the same paint step as the ghost, where
            source order decides — ghost first, incoming over it — so the new
            content is legible from its first frame and the ghost does the one
