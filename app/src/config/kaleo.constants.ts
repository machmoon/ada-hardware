 * This is the repository's existing answer to "read a credential from the

 * process env at all** — there is no `process`, and `std::env` lives in Rust.
 * `service/envfiles.py` already writes and reads exactly this shape for
 * `billing`, `google` and `microsoft`: one flat `KEY=value` file per provider,
 * 0600 under a 0700 `~/.kaleo`, applied at start with **setdefault**
 * semantics so a real process-environment value always wins over a file.
 *
 * `voice` is the fourth file, and it carries `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` — the name
 * ElevenLabs' own SDKs read, so a developer who has already exported it can
 * `echo "ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=$ELEVENLABS_API_KEY" > ~/.kaleo/voice.env` and be
 * done. The service half (registering `voice` in `envfiles.FILES` so the
 * Setup Assistant can write it) is a one-line follow-up in a file this change
 * does not own; the file works today whether or not that lands, because the
 * app reads it directly.
 *
 * Path, not `BaseDirectory`-relative-to-anything-clever: it is read through
 * the fs plugin's `$HOME` base, and the capability files scope
 * `$HOME/.kaleo/*.env` for exactly this.
