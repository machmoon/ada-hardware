"""``GET /integrations`` and the report behind it (``service/integrations.py``).

Every test drives :func:`service.integrations.integrations_report` with an
injected ``environ``, which is what keeps this offline and machine-independent:
nothing here is allowed to depend on whether *this* laptop happens to have
ngspice or KiCad, so the credential-shaped integrations are asserted exactly
and the tool-shaped ones are asserted only against the schema and the four
legal states.

The two properties that matter most have a test each: no secret value ever
appears in the serialised response, and the ``google`` entry agrees with
``GET /deliver/config`` -- the two routes read the same source, so a user can
never be told two different stories about whether Hardy can send mail.
