"""Typing at the strip while a run is in flight (``service/amend.py``).

Offline, on the ``test_steps.py`` harness: the scripted model answers propose
and the case, the placer is deterministic, the datasheet probe is a fake.

What these tests are really pinning is a set of *honesty* properties, because
this feature's whole risk is promising the engineer more than the pipeline can
do. Three of them are worth naming:

* a note never reaches a stage that has already run, and never rewrites the
  circuit under a placement that was solved for a different one;
* cancellation lands at an event boundary, so a model call already in flight
  is still paid for -- ``test_cancel_does_not_unspend_a_model_call_in_flight``
  asserts the money was spent rather than pretending otherwise;
* a note typed during a 20 s placement is answered while the placement runs,
  not after it.
