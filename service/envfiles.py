"""The ``~/.kaleo/*.env`` files: where a desktop install keeps what Setup saved.

Three files, one per account the Setup Assistant can connect -- ``billing``
(Stripe), ``google`` (the OAuth client and the Chat webhook) and ``microsoft``
(the Entra app registration) -- each a flat ``KEY=value`` file written 0600
under a 0700 directory, and each read back at **startup, by an explicit call**
(``service.app.main`` and ``desktop/launcher.py``), never at import. A module
that reads the developer's real ``~/.kaleo`` the moment a test imports it is a
module whose tests depend on what the developer connected last week.

Precedence, stated once: a value already in the process environment always
wins over a file. :func:`apply_env` is ``setdefault`` and nothing else, so a
deployment's Secret Manager injection, a shell ``export`` or a ``.env`` the
launcher already read cannot be overridden by a file left on a laptop. Every
save reports whether the running process is actually using what it just
wrote (:func:`activation`).

Demo state is kept strictly apart. ``KALEO_SETUP_MODE=demo`` records its
pretend sign-ins under ``~/.kaleo/demo/``; those files start with a header and
carry :data:`DEMO_MARKER` (``KALEO_DEMO=1``), and the rule is enforced on
**both** sides of the boundary rather than by path alone: a live read of any
file carrying the marker is refused, a live save into ``demo/`` is refused, a
demo read of a file *without* the marker is refused, and
:func:`apply_saved_env` never opens the demo directory at all. A demo file
that leaked into the environment would make ``/integrations`` claim an
account that was never connected.

Atomicity and permissions are the same rule ``googleapps/auth.py`` and
``billing_routes`` already keep, done properly: ``tempfile.mkstemp`` creates
the temporary 0600 in the target directory and ``os.replace`` swaps it in, so
there is never a moment when a half-written or world-readable credential
exists on disk. A symlinked home, directory or target is refused outright --
following one would write a secret wherever the link points.
