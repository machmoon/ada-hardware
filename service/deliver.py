"""Delivering a step session to Google Workspace (``googleapps/``).

The desktop overlay runs the pipeline as approval-gated steps
(``service/steps.py``). Once the copper is down, the engineer may want the
result where the team already looks -- a Chat space, an inbox with the board
attached, a review on the calendar -- and ``python -m googleapps run`` cannot
do that for a run that already happened. These two routes can:

    GET  /deliver/config          what is configured; never a secret
    POST /deliver/auth/start      consent URL for Hardy to open (client opens it)
    POST /deliver/auth            finish Hardy sign-in, or all-in-one server open
    POST /steps/<id>/deliver      send the named session to Chat / Gmail / Calendar,
                                  or book a spec review (agenda + Meet link)

This module is an adapter and nothing more. The card, the email and the event
are built by ``googleapps.chat`` / ``gmail`` / ``calendar`` from a
``PipelineResult``-shaped object, and :class:`SessionResult` presents a
:class:`~service.steps.Session` in that shape -- the whole surface the package
depends on, listed in one place -- so nothing here reaches into the pipeline
or reimplements a formatter. The package's rules carry over unchanged: every
address is validated before a byte is sent, the Calendar event is created only
when the review found blockers (and it says so either way), and the routing
story names every unrouted net.

Each destination succeeds or fails on its own. One response reports all of
them, HTTP 200 even when one failed, because "the card posted but Gmail
refused the token" is a result, not an error; only bad input (an address that
would not survive a MIME header, nothing asked for) is a 400, and it happens
before any request leaves.

``googleapps`` is imported lazily: the deployed image and the engine wheel
carry ``service/`` without it, and a service that cannot import at all is
worse than one whose delivery routes say "not installed".
