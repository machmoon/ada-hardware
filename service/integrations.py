"""What this service could talk to right now -- ``GET /integrations``.

One read-only, aggregated, always-200 view of every front end and optional
tool the repo carries: the Workspace delivery routes, the Slack bot, the Meet
/ Zoom / Teams meeting front ends, the enclosure kernel, the sourcing BOM, the
MCP server, SPICE, ``kicad-cli`` and the Anthropic (Claude) model provider. The desktop overlay renders it as a
settings panel, so the contract is that it never fails and never lies.

Four states, and the distinction is the whole point (a missing package, a
missing credential and a half-filled one are three different problems):

``unavailable``
    The code is not here at all -- an optional extra is not installed, a
    binary is not on PATH, a package has not been written yet. ``hints`` names
    the extra or says the feature is not built.
``unconfigured``
    Importable, nothing set.
``partial``
    Some required settings present, some missing (or one is malformed).
    ``hints`` names each gap **and** says the service does not read ``.env``,
    because the service genuinely does not (only the two CLIs do) and a hint
    that names a variable without saying so sends the reader to a file nothing
    opens.
``ready``
    Everything required is present. This is a claim about *configuration* and
    nothing else: no route here makes a live call, so ``detail`` must never
    read as "a round trip succeeded".

Two rules hold everywhere. **No secret is ever echoed** -- not a value, not a
tail (a webhook URL's tail is the token); ``shown`` carries the
``<set, N chars>`` mask ``slackbot.config.Config.redacted`` uses, and only a
setting that is not a credential (a path, a base URL, an allowlist) shows its
value. And **nothing raises out of this module**: a probe that blows up
becomes that one integration's ``state`` and ``hints``, never a 500 that hides
the nine integrations that were fine.

The ``google`` entry is derived from :func:`service.deliver.config_report`
rather than re-deriving it, so ``GET /integrations`` and ``GET
/deliver/config`` cannot disagree about whether Ada can send mail.
