"""The first-launch Setup Assistant's service: ``GET /setup`` and friends.

The desktop wizard (``app/src/pages/welcome``) asks one question per screen --
connect Google, connect Microsoft, set up billing -- and this module is what
it asks. It owns no engine logic and reaches no account of its own: Google
sign-in is ``service.deliver``'s job, the Stripe check is
``service.billing_routes``', the Entra check is ``teamsbot.graph``'s, and
what each of those saved lives in ``service.envfiles``. What this module
adds is one shape for all three, the demo mode, and the honesty rules.

Routes (all behind the bearer gate, all ``Cache-Control: no-store``)::

    GET  /setup                          the whole report
    GET  /setup/google|microsoft|stripe  one provider, non-blocking
    GET  /setup/voice                    which voice Ada has, and the one
                                         command that provisions it if none
    POST /setup/google/connect           202 {auth_url, job}; the client opens it
    POST /setup/google/disconnect        delete the token here (not at Google)
    POST /setup/google/credentials       {client_id, client_secret}: shape only
    POST /setup/microsoft/credentials    {app_id, app_secret, tenant_id, verify_only?}
    POST /setup/microsoft/disconnect
    POST /setup/stripe/credentials       billing_routes' payload
    GET  /setup/demo/consent?provider=google&state=<nonce>    demo only, PUBLIC
    POST /setup/demo/consent             form: provider, state, decision

Every JSON body carries ``mode`` (``live`` or ``demo``) and every integration
object carries ``demo``; ``state`` uses the ``/integrations`` vocabulary
(``ready`` / ``partial`` / ``unconfigured`` / ``unavailable``), and in live
mode the Google state is copied from ``/integrations`` rather than derived
again, so the two routes cannot disagree.

**Demo mode is server-side and nothing else.** ``KALEO_SETUP_MODE=demo`` makes
the connect steps record pretend sign-ins under ``~/.kaleo/demo/`` -- files
that carry ``KALEO_DEMO=1``, are never exported into ``os.environ`` and are
never read at startup -- and makes **zero outbound calls**: the Entra
transport is never built, the Stripe check goes to an in-process transport
that recognises one literal key, and the Google consent page is served by
this process. ``/integrations`` keeps saying ``unconfigured`` in demo, which
is the truth, and ``/setup`` says ``ready, demo: true``, which is also the
truth. The client never simulates a connection itself.

The consent page is the one public route (``is_public_demo_route``): it is
opened by a browser that cannot send the bearer, so it is gated by a 256-bit
single-use nonce with a ten-minute life instead, only in demo mode, and
only for a request whose ``Host`` is loopback -- a page on
``attacker.example`` cannot make a browser's DNS-rebound request pass that.

    This exists because of a provisioning cliff with teeth. Kokoro needs

    silently pulls a third of a gigabyte is a surprise on a metered connection
    and a hang on a hot path. The cost of that refusal used to be paid
    invisibly: with no weights the client fell through to the webview's own
    ``speechSynthesis``, and the macOS Compact voice became what Ada sounded
    like, with nothing anywhere saying it was a fallback.

    The client no longer falls through -- an unprovisioned engine now means
    silence -- and silence needs a place to explain itself. This is that
    place, so the wizard can say "no voice yet, here is the one command"
    rather than leaving a person to wonder why the app stopped talking.

    The states are read straight off :func:`service.tts.speak_report` rather
    than re-derived, for the reason ``google_status`` copies its state out of
    ``integrations_report``: two answers to "is the voice ready" that are
    computed separately will eventually disagree, and then neither is
    trustworthy. ``ready`` here means the same thing it means everywhere else
